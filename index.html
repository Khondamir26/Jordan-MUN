        <div class="main_content container">
            <p class="main_text">As the effects of climate change and global crises continue unfold, food insecurity has become a challenge facing more and more countries around the world. In Jordan, young people are coming together and using local innovations to address systemic food security issues facing their communities and overcome the various factors including slow economic growth, high youth unemployment, water scarcity and increased cost of living that are driving the current food crisis. Water scarcity is a reality in Jordan, as the country is counted among the world’s most arid countries. The situation has been exacerbated by the large-scale influx of refugees due to the Syrian crisis. The current per capita water supply in Jordan is 200m3 per year which is almost one-third of the global average. To make matters worse, it is projected that per capita water availability will decline to measly 90m3 by the year 2025. Thus, it is of paramount importance to augment water supply in addition to sustainable use of available water resources.   Jordan is the second most water scarce country in the world. Jordan’s annual renewable water resources are less than 100 m3 per person, significantly below the threshold of 500 m3 per person which defines severe water scarcity. While more than 98% of the population has access to an improved water source, only 93% access a safely-managed source and 86% to a piped network. In urban areas, water is usually available once a week, and less than once every two weeks in rural areas, with reduced frequency during the summer. Only 77.3% of existing sanitation systems are safely managed and only a third of schools have basic sanitation services

            <p class="main_text_2">
                The situation in informal settlements is of particular concern due to high rates of open defecation and the limited access to safe water. Vulnerable households are forced to spend a large portion of their limited incomes on limited and poor quality services.

                 Climate change is expected to have a significant impact on Jordan, most likely leading to     increased temperatures, variation in precipitation patterns, extreme weather events, and flash flooding. This will compromise the resilience of water and sanitation services making it more complex the achievement towards Sustainable Development Goal 6.

                 Key hygiene norms, including handwashing, are well-practiced in Jordan, but gaps remain in access to basic hygiene items for vulnerable households.

                UNICEF supports immediate, sustainable and high impact projects, with a focus on water and environmental conservation, to increase access to safely managed water and sanitation services for the most vulnerable children and their families.

                Working closely with the Ministry of Water and Irrigation, and key stakeholders, UNICEF interventions support policies and strategies that improve the water supply and sanitation infrastructure in cities, schools, refugee camps and at community and household levels - and promote social cohesion and equitable access to water and sanitation for the most vulnerable children, including:

        <div class="main_content container">
            <p class="main_text">Jordan has begun its recovery from the COVID‑19 shock — real GDP grew by 2.2% in 2021 following a 1.6% contraction in 2020. However, the COVID‑19 crisis has exacerbated Jordan’s jobs challenge: Unemployment stood at 23.3% in Q4‑2021, youth unemployment reached nearly 50% and the women’s labor force participation rate is 14%, one of the lowest in the world.  Jordan's economy is thwarted by at least three structural problems, explaining the persistence of high youth unemployment. First, the mismatch between education outputs and the skills required by the labour market cause high unemployment among university graduates. Second, the inability of both the private and public sector to absorb new market labour entrants and to create more decent jobs. Third, lacking access to and quality of national programs that facilitate a smooth school-to-work transition, including vocational training and career guidance. In consequence, Jordan is negatively affected by a great extend of emigration of its educational elite, resulting in brain drain. High unemployment rates, widening external imbalances, elevated debt levels and weak investment highlight sizable challenges to a robust recovery.

                Unemployment is one of the primary concerns in the present world. A lot of people are dealing with unemployment. The measures to solve unemployment problems are as under-

                Change in industrial technique- to solve the problem of unemployment, a production technique focusing on the needs and means of the country should be adopted. Capital-intensive technology should be replaced by labour-intensive technology.
                Dealing with seasonal unemployment- As agro-based and agriculture sectors provide only seasonal employment. Measures like multi-cropping, animal husbandry, horticulture, plantation, and horticulture should be adopted. Also, industries like the cotton industry should be promoted.
                Changes in the Education system- There is a need to change the present education system. It should emphasize on vocational education rather than imparting static knowledge. Colleges and universities should be available to students who wish to pursue higher education.
                Assistance on Self employment- Most people in India are self-employed, but unfortunately, due to lack of knowledge, they are not able to give the desired results. Therefore, they should be helped by giving technical training and using the raw material properly.
                Introduction of new governmental measures- The government should take the initiative to increase labor productivity and develop better employment opportunities for all.
                Population control- Population is one of the major concerns associated with the unemployment rate. Therefore, the population rate needs to be checked, especially in rural areas where birth control methods and family planning considerations are not offered.

                Amman, Jordan, 18 October 2022– More than 400 young people in Jordan who have completed intensive, career-related training to support their successful transition to the labour market as part of the Job Search Clubs from UNICEF and the ILO, in coordination with the Ministry of Youth, were celebrated during an official event in Amman. The Minister of Youth, Mohammad Al Nabulsi, and Deputy Head of Mission of Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Pier de Vries, took part in the ceremony, along with the youth’s facilitators and representatives of partner organizations.  

                The Jobs Search Clubs programme is supported by the Kingdom of the Netherlands, through the PROSPECTS partnership, and implemented by the Business Development Centre (BDC). To date, 80 facilitators have been trained, including Ministry of Youth staff in different governorates and volunteers in refugee camps, to deliver youth training and to continue supporting young people as they seek employment with one-on-one follow up.

                “The Ministry has contributed along its partners, including national institutions, international organizations and civil society in preparing, training and empowering young people to enter the labour market,” said Jordan’s Youth Minister Muhammad al-Nabulsi. “We are supporting youth in their quest for suitable job opportunities, while also preparing the facilitators who are working with them across the country’s centres.”

            <p class="main_water-solution">
                Based on two-week job search support activities, the JSCs bring together different individuals facing similar challenges to enter the labour market. Young people receive intensive coaching by the new trained facilitators on job search-related skills. Following an initial assessment of their personal interests, skills and occupational goals, the members learn how to gather job leads from various sources, conduct job interviews, fill out applications, write CVs and handle stressful situations, among others.

                At the end of the two-week intensive programme, jobseekers benefit from a further three-month window in which they will receive assessments on their employment status by the UN agencies.

                The JSC is an ILO methodology, providing youth with activities set to help them find suitable work within a short period of time. The programme fosters peer-to-peer exchanges among young job seekers, creates new connections, while allowing them to hone their job search abilities, matching their qualifications and skillset.

                The Job Search Clubs programme is set to help boost youth employment in the country. Prior to COVID-19, the unemployment rate among young people in Jordan was 32 per cent, but this has increased due to the impact of the pandemic. According to the Jordan Department of Statistics (DoS), unemployment for youth in the 15-24 age bracket has reached over 46 per cent in the second quarter of 2022, affecting more than 63 percent of young women and 42 percent of young men in the country.
